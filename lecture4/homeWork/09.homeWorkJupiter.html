                                Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a
                                gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in
                                the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
                                Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
                                and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman
                                god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.
                                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its
                                mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements,[16]
                                but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The
                                on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received
                                from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate
                                spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere
                                is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and
                                storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red
                                Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when
                                it was first seen by telescope.<br><br>

                                Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere.
                                Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to
                                Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more,[6] including the four
                                large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of
                                these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
                                Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the
                                planet in December 1973.[17] Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by
                                robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to
                                1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995.[18] In 2007,
                                Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase
                                its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the
                                planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.[19][20] Future targets for
                                exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of the
                                moon Europa.[21]

                                Jupiter is most likely the oldest planet in the Solar System.[24] Current models of
                                Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line; a
                                distance from the early Sun where the temperature is sufficiently cold for volatiles
                                such as water to condense into solids.[25] It first assembled a large solid core before
                                accumulating its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the core must have formed before
                                the solar nebula began to dissipate after 10 million years. Formation models suggest
                                Jupiter grew to 20 times the mass of the Earth in under a million years. The orbiting
                                mass created a gap in the disk, thereafter slowly increasing to 50 Earth masses in 3–4
                                million years.[24]
                                According to the "grand tack hypothesis", Jupiter would have begun to form at a distance
                                of roughly 3.5 AU. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk
                                orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn[25] caused it to migrate inward.[26]
                                This would have upset the orbits of what are believed to be super-Earths orbiting closer
                                to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively. Saturn would later have begun to
                                migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, leading to the two planets becoming
                                locked in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU. This in turn would have
                                changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of
                                the inner system to their current locations.[27] These migrations would have occurred
                                over an 800,000 year time period,[26] with all of this happening over a time period of
                                up to 6 million years after Jupiter began to form (3 million being a more likely
                                figure).[28] This departure would have allowed the formation of the inner planets from
                                the rubble, including Earth.[29]<br><br>

                                However, the formation timescales of terrestrial planets resulting from the grand tack
                                hypothesis appear inconsistent with the measured terrestrial composition.[30] Moreover,
                                the likelihood that the outward migration actually occurred in the solar nebula is very
                                low.[31] In fact, some models predict the formation of Jupiter's analogues whose
                                properties are close to those of the planet at the current epoch.[32]
                                Other models have Jupiter forming at distances much further out, such as 18 AU.[33][34]
                                In fact, based on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial
                                formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20-30
                                AU,[35][36] and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40 AU.
                                Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have migrated
                                inwards to its current location. This inward migration would have occurred over a
                                roughly 700,000 year time period,[33][34] during an epoch approximately 2–3 million
                                years after the planet began to form. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even
                                further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.
