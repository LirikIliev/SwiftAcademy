                                Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System,
                                it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
                                densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its
                                near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its
                                greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits
                                the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8
                                billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol
                                ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.
                                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System
                                found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected
                                changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject
                                to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position
                                of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and
                                Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September
                                1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its
                                largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                                remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The
                                planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging
                                to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by
                                the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit
                                Neptune.[17][18] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based
                                telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed
                                observations from afar.<br><br>

                                August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.[17][18] The advent
                                of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has
                                recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.
                                Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and
                                helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a
                                higher proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to
                                Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[19] Uranus and Neptune are
                                normally considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction.[20] Traces of methane in
                                the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance,[21] though an
                                unknown component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to Uranus.[21]
                                In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's
                                atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the
                                Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot
                                comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in 2018, a newer main dark
                                spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[22] In addition, these weather
                                patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System,
                                with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[23] Because of its
                                great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in
                                the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361
                                °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300
                                °F).[24][25] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which was
                                discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.

                                Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's
                                drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match up
                                with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems
                                to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to
                                Jupiter in the night sky.[27] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his
                                first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it
                                had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when
                                Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its
                                yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with
                                Galileo's small telescope.[28] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least
                                aware that the "star" he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.[29]
                                In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's
                                neighbour Uranus.[30] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the
                                tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit
                                through gravitational interaction.[31] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit
                                of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the
                                Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46
                                and produced several different estimates of a new planet<br><br>

                                n 1845–46, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but
                                aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first
                                published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate,
                                Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky
                                throughout August and September.[31][34]
                                Meanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann
                                Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student
                                at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of
                                the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek
                                the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening
                                of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just
                                northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1° from the "five degrees east of Delta Capricorn" position
                                Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[35][36] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and on the
                                border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.
                                Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but
                                did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was
                                distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[31][37]
                                In the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the
                                French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an
                                international consensus emerged that Le Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since
                                1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery,
                                and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the "Neptune
                                papers" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
