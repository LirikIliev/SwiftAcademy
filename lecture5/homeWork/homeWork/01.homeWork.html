                                The Solar System[b] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that
                                orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[c] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly,
                                the largest are the eight planets,[d] with the remainder being smaller objects, the
                                dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun
                                indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[e]
                                <br> <br>

                                The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
                                interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with
                                the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner system
                                planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily
                                composed of rock and metal. The four outer system planets are giant planets, being
                                substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and
                                Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost
                                planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with
                                relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such
                                as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie
                                within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic. <br><br>

                                The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[f] The asteroid belt, which lies between
                                the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial
                                planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered
                                disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and
                                beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some
                                objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is
                                considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.[9][10] Such objects are
                                categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another
                                trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to
                                being a dwarf planet.[f] In addition to these two regions, various other small-body
                                populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel
                                between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of
                                the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the
                                Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small
                                objects. <br><br>

                                The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a
                                bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause
                                is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of
                                the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort
                                cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a
                                distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is
                                located 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy in the Orion Arm,
                                which contains most of the visible stars in the night sky. The nearest stars are within
                                the so-called Local Bubble, with the closest Proxima Centauri at 4.25 light-years.
