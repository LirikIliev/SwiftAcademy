                                Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and
                                beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can
                                cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad
                                daylight.[17][18] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far
                                from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little
                                while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[19] It has a synodic day
                                length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a
                                consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar
                                System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun
                                rises in the west and sets in the east.[20] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction
                                it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[21]<br><br>

                                Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of
                                their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically
                                different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
                                terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric
                                pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or
                                roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is
                                closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with
                                a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
                                highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from
                                space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[22][23] but these
                                would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[24] The
                                water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
                                interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic
                                field.[25] As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in
                                human
                                culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many
                                cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star"
                                and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the
                                sky, as early as the second millennium BC.

                                dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate.
                                Additionally, the atmosphere consists of approximately 1% ferric chloride.[49][50] Other
                                possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and
                                phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and
                                particle size distributions.[49] These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the
                                sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of Venus's
                                surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the
                                Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong 300 km/h (185 mph) winds at the
                                cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[51] Winds on Venus move
                                at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only
                                10–20% rotation speed.[52]

                                The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not
                                only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[5][53] Venus's
                                minute axial tilt—less than 3°, compared to 23° on Earth—also minimises seasonal
                                temperature variation.[54] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian
                                temperature. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point
                                on Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C; 715 °F) and an atmospheric pressure
                                of about 4.5 MPa (45 bar).[55][56] In 1995, the Magellan spacecraft imaged a highly
                                reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong
                                resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to
                                snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it
                                rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The
                                identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from
                                elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena)

                                As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human
                                culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many
                                cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star"
                                and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the
                                sky, as early as the second millennium BC.Venus's atmosphere is extremely rich in
                                primordial noble gases compared to that of Earth.[35] This enrichment indicates an early
                                divergence from Earth in evolution. An unusually large comet impact[36] or accretion of
                                a more massive primary atmosphere from solar nebula[37] have been proposed to explain
                                the enrichment. However, the atmosphere is also depleted of radiogenic argon, a proxy to
                                mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major magmatism.[38][39]Studies have
                                suggested that billions of years ago, Venus's atmosphere could have been
                                much more like the one surrounding the early Earth, and that there may have been
                                substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface. After a period of 600 million to
                                several billion years,[40] solar forcing from rising luminosity of the Sun caused the
                                evaporation of the original water. A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a
                                critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was added to its atmosphere.[41]
                                Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earth-like life
                                that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that
                                life exists in the upper cloud layers of Venus, 50 km (30 mi) up from the surface, where
                                the temperature ranges between 303 and 353 K (30 and 80 °C; 86 and 176 °F) but the
                                environment is acidic.[42][43][44] The putative detection of phosphine in Venus's
                                atmosphere, with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in
                                September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the
                                atmosphere.[45][46] Later research, not yet peer reviewed, attributed the spectroscopic
                                signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide. <br><br>

                                Thermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the
                                temperature of Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the planet's two
                                hemispheres, those facing and not facing the Sun, despite Venus's extremely slow
                                rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few kilometres per hour, but
                                because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant
                                amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the
