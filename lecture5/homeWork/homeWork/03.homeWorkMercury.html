            <h1>Mercury</h1>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>

                                Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit
                                around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is
                                named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods,
                                and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
                                Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its
                                apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to
                                the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the
                                eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a
                                bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. From
                                Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus
                                and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. <br><br>

                                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with
                                the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it
                                rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the
                                Sun.[a][18] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital
                                motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury
                                would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years. Mercury's axis has the
                                smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30
                                degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar
                                System;[b] at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or
                                66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is
                                similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
                                for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface
                                temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System,
                                ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day
                                across the equatorial regions.[19] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C;
                                −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites. <br><br>

                                Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like
                                Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of
                                2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).[3] Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the
                                largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of
                                approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury appears to have a solid
                                silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper
                                liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.[30][31] The planet's density is the second
                                highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of
                                5.515 g/cm3.[3] If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from
                                both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of
                                Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.[32] Mercury's
                                density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high
                                density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core,
                                Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it
                                to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.[33] Geologists
                                estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 55% of its volume; for Earth this
                                proportion is 17%. Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten
                                core.[34][35] Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km (310–430 mi) mantle consisting of
                                silicates.[36][37] Based on data from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth-based
                                observation, Mercury's crust is estimated to be 35 km (22 mi) thick.[38] However, this
                                model may be an overestimate and the crust could be 26 ± 11 km (16.2 ± 6.8 mi) thick
                                based on an Airy isostacy model.[39] One distinctive feature of Mercury's surface is the
                                presence of numerous narrow ridges, extending up to several hundred kilometers in
                                length. It is thought that these were formed as Mercury's core and mantle cooled and
                                contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified.[40][41][42]

                                Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive
                                mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
                                for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous than either Mars's or the Moon's, both
                                of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and
                                plateaus.[49] Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which
                                include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features
                                correspond to higher reflectivity plains.[50] Mercury has dorsa (also called
                                "wrinkle-ridges"), Moon-like highlands, montes (mountains), planitiae (plains), rupes
                                (escarpments), and valles (valleys). The planet's mantle is chemically heterogeneous,
                                suggesting the planet went through a magma ocean phase early in its history.
                                Crystallization of minerals and convective overturn resulted in layered, chemically
                                heterogeneous crust with large-scale variations in chemical composition observed on the
                                surface. The crust is low in iron but high in sulfur, resulting from the stronger early
                                chemically reducing conditions than is found in the other terrestrial planets. The
                                surface is dominated by iron-poor pyroxene and olivine, as represented by enstatite and
                                forsterite, respectively, along with sodium-rich plagioclase and minerals of mixed
                                magnesium, calcium, and iron-sulfide. The less reflective regions of the crust are high
                                in carbon, most likely in the form of graphite. Names for features on Mercury come from
                                a variety of sources. Names coming from people are limited to the deceased. Craters are
                                named for artists, musicians, painters, and authors who have made outstanding or
                                fundamental contributions to their field. Ridges, or dorsa, are named for scientists who
                                have contributed to the study of Mercury. Depressions or fossae are named for works of
                                architecture. Montes are named for the word "hot" in a variety of languages. Plains or
                                planitiae are named for Mercury in various languages. Escarpments or rupēs are named for
                                ships of scientific expeditions. Valleys or valles are named for abandoned cities,
                                towns, or settlements of antiquity. <br><br>

                                Mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its
                                formation 4.6 billion years ago, as well as during a possibly separate subsequent
                                episode called the Late Heavy Bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago.[55] Mercury
                                received impacts over its entire surface during this period of intense crater
                                formation,[52] facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down.[56]
                                During this time Mercury was volcanically active; basins were filled by magma, producing
                                smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon.[57][58] An unusual crater with
                                radiating troughs has been discovered that scientists called "the spider".[59] It was
                                later named Apollodorus.[60] Craters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped
                                cavities to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all
                                states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater
                                remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed
                                by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury's stronger surface
                                gravity.[61] According to International Astronomical Union (IAU) rules, each new crater
                                must be named after an artist who was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for
                                more than three years, before the date the crater is named.[62]
