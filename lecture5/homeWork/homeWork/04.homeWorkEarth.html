                                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour
                                and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and
                                islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and
                                other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together
                                constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's
                                outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the
                                surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron
                                inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective
                                mantle that drives plate tectonics. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and
                                oxygen. More solar energy is received
                                by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean
                                circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface
                                temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by
                                elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such
                                as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly
                                impacts life.<br><br>

                                Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is
                                Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days.
                                Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons
                                on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides,
                                stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is
                                the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four
                                rocky planets. According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth
                                formed over 4.5
                                billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in
                                the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the
                                proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence
                                indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. <br><br>

                                Since then, the
                                combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological
                                history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
                                biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
                                extinctions. More than 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8
                                billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their
                                survival. Humans increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes,
                                and other life.

                                The modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun
                                most often spelled eorðe.[25] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their
                                ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word
                                eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ
                                gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including
                                the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may
                                have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð
                                ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.
                                Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its
                                definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the earth. By Early Modern English, many
                                nouns were capitalized, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when
                                referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply
                                given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms
                                with the remain common.[25] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the
                                lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant.
                                Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (for example, "Earth's
                                atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (for example, "the
                                atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial
                                expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"<br><br>

                                Occasionally, the name Terra /ˈtɛrə/ is used in scientific writing and especially in
                                science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[28] while in
                                poetry Tellus /ˈtɛləs/ has been used to denote personification of the Earth.[29] Terra
                                is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that evolved from
                                Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise
                                to names with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre).
                                The Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English: /ˈdʒiːə/) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (Γαῖα;
                                Ancient Greek: [ɡâi̯.a] or [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has
                                become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is /ˈɡaɪə/
                                rather than the more classical English /ˈɡeɪə/.

                                There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From Earth itself comes earthly.
                                From the Latin Terra comes terran /ˈtɛrən/,[31] terrestrial /təˈrɛstriəl/,[32] and (via
                                French) terrene /təˈriːn/,[33] and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian
                                /tɛˈlʊəriən/[34] and telluric.[35]
