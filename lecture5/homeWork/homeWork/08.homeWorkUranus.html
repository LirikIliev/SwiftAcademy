            <h1>Uranus</h1>

                                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of
                                the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares
                                (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the
                                third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
                                Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions
                                which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason,
                                scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from
                                the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its
                                primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water,
                                ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest
                                planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C;
                                −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the
                                lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.[17] The interior of Uranus is
                                mainly composed of ices and rock.<br><br>

                                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous
                                moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is
                                tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles,
                                therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.[22] In 1986, images from
                                Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
                                cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[22] Voyager 2 remains the
                                only spacecraft to visit the planet.[23] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal
                                change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind
                                speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                                The name of Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (Ancient Greek:
                                Οὐρανός), the father of Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), which in
                                Latin became Ūranus (IPA: [ˈuːranʊs]).[1] It is the only planet whose English name is
                                derived directly from a figure of Greek mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is
                                "Uranian".[41] The pronunciation of the name Uranus preferred among astronomers is
                                /ˈjʊərənəs/ YOOR-ə-nəs,[2] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin Ūranus, in
                                contrast to /jʊˈreɪnəs/ yoo-RAY-nəs, with stress on the second syllable and a long a,
                                though both are considered acceptable.[f]
                                Consensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's
                                discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel
                                to "do the astronomical world the faver [sic] to give a name to your planet, which is
                                entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of".[43]
                                In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object Georgium Sidus
                                (George's Star), or the "Georgian Planet" in honour of his new patron, King George
                                III.[44] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks.<br><br>

                                In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter
                                and Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and
                                divinities. In the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have
                                recourse to the same method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to
                                our new heavenly body. The first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable
                                incident, seems to be its chronology: if in any future age it should be asked, when this
                                last-found Planet was discovered? It would be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the
                                reign of King George the Third'.
