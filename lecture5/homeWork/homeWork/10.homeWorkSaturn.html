                                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System,
                                after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times
                                that of Earth.[22][23] It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however,
                                with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[24][25][26] Saturn is
                                named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has
                                been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek
                                kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for
                                the planet.[27] It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added
                                at the top in the 16th century.
                                The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for
                                the planet Saturn.<br><br>

                                Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and
                                oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
                                intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer
                                layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An
                                electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to
                                Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has a
                                magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic
                                field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[29] The outer atmosphere is
                                generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind
                                speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but
                                not as high as on Neptune.
                                The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly
                                of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons[31]
                                are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the
                                hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest
                                in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is
                                the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[32]

                                Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite
                                surface, though it may have a solid core.[33] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the
                                shape of an oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its
                                equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268 km versus 54,364
                                km.[10] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are
                                also oblate but to a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means
                                that the effective surface gravity along the equator, 8.96 m/s2, is 74% of what it is at
                                the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape
                                velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[34]
                                Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30%
                                less.[35] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific
                                density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth's
                                mass,[36] and Saturn is 95 times Earth's mass.[10] Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92%
                                of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.<br><br>

                                Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the
                                gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01
                                g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature,
                                pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes
                                hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.[37]
                                Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of
                                Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts
                                of various volatiles.[38] This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more
                                dense. The examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical
                                models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's
                                core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of
                                Earth,[39][40] which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000 km.[41] However,
                                measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to
                                about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[42] This is
                                surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of
                                helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing
                                altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000 km and consists of gas.[43][44][45]
                                Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more
                                energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated
                                by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process
                                alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less
                                massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the
                                "raining out" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend
                                through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves
                                Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[46][47] These descending droplets may have
                                accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[38] Rainfalls of diamonds have
                                been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[48] and ice giants Uranus
                                and Neptune.
