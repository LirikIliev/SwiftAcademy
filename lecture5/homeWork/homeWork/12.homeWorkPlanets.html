                            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and
                            beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can
                            cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad
                            daylight.[17][18] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far
                            from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little
                            while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[19] It has a synodic day
                            length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a
                            consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar
                            System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This means the Sun
                            rises in the west and sets in the east.[20] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction
                            it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[21]<br><br>

                            Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of
                            their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically
                            different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four
                            terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric
                            pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or
                            roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is
                            closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with
                            a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
                            highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from
                            space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[22][23] but these
                            would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.[24] The
                            water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
                            interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic
                            field.[25] As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in
                            human
                            culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many
                            cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star"
                            and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the
                            sky, as early as the second millennium BC.

                            dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate.
                            Additionally, the atmosphere consists of approximately 1% ferric chloride.[49][50] Other
                            possible constituents of the cloud particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and
                            phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and
                            particle size distributions.[49] These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the
                            sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of Venus's
                            surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the
                            Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong 300 km/h (185 mph) winds at the
                            cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days.[51] Winds on Venus move
                            at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only
                            10–20% rotation speed.[52]

                            The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not
                            only between the two hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[5][53] Venus's
                            minute axial tilt—less than 3°, compared to 23° on Earth—also minimises seasonal
                            temperature variation.[54] Altitude is one of the few factors that affect Venusian
                            temperature. The highest point on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point
                            on Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C; 715 °F) and an atmospheric pressure
                            of about 4.5 MPa (45 bar).[55][56] In 1995, the Magellan spacecraft imaged a highly
                            reflective substance at the tops of the highest mountain peaks that bore a strong
                            resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed from a similar process to
                            snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it
                            rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The
                            identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from
                            elemental tellurium to lead sulfide (galena)

                            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit
                            around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is
                            named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods,
                            and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
                            Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its
                            apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to
                            the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the
                            eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a
                            bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. From
                            Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus
                            and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days. <br><br>

                            Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with
                            the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it
                            rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the
                            Sun.[a][18] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital
                            motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury
                            would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years. Mercury's axis has the
                            smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30
                            degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar
                            System;[b] at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or
                            66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is
                            similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
                            for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface
                            temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System,
                            ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day
                            across the equatorial regions.[19] The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C;
                            −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites. <br><br>

                            Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like
                            Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of
                            2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).[3] Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the
                            largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of
                            approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury appears to have a solid
                            silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper
                            liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.[30][31] The planet's density is the second
                            highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of
                            5.515 g/cm3.[3] If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from
                            both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of
                            Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.[32] Mercury's
                            density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high
                            density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core,
                            Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it
                            to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.[33] Geologists
                            estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 55% of its volume; for Earth this
                            proportion is 17%. Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten
                            core.[34][35] Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km (310–430 mi) mantle consisting of
                            silicates.[36][37] Based on data from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth-based
                            observation, Mercury's crust is estimated to be 35 km (22 mi) thick.[38] However, this
                            model may be an overestimate and the crust could be 26 ± 11 km (16.2 ± 6.8 mi) thick
                            based on an Airy isostacy model.[39] One distinctive feature of Mercury's surface is the
                            presence of numerous narrow ridges, extending up to several hundred kilometers in
                            length. It is thought that these were formed as Mercury's core and mantle cooled and
                            contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified.[40][41][42]

                            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour
                            and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and
                            islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and
                            other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together
                            constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's
                            outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the
                            surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron
                            inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective
                            mantle that drives plate tectonics. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and
                            oxygen. More solar energy is received
                            by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean
                            circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface
                            temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by
                            elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such
                            as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly
                            impacts life.<br><br>

                            Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is
                            Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days.
                            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons
                            on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides,
                            stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is
                            the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four
                            rocky planets. According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth
                            formed over 4.5
                            billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in
                            the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the
                            proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence
                            indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. <br><br>

                            Since then, the
                            combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological
                            history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
                            biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
                            extinctions. More than 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8
                            billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their
                            survival. Humans increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes,
                            and other life.

                            [29] NASA landed its Curiosity rover on August 6,
                            2012, as a part of its Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission to investigate Martian
                            climate and geology.[30] On 24 September 2014, the Indian Space Research Organisation
                            (ISRO) became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when its maiden interplanetary
                            mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, arrived in orbit.[31] The United Arab
                            Emirates became the fifth to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, having inserted
                            an orbiter into the Martian atmosphere on 9 February 2021.[32] China National Space
                            Administration (CNSA)'s Tianwen-1 spacecraft arrived in Martian orbit on 10 February
                            2021.[33] NASA's Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter successfully landed on Mars
                            on 18 February 2021.[34] Ingenuity successfully completed the first powered controlled
                            flight by an aircraft on any planet besides Earth on 19 April 2021, taking off
                            vertically, hovering and landing on Mars.[35][36] On 14 May 2021, CNSA's Tianwen-1
                            lander and Zhurong rover successfully landed on Mars.[37] Zhurong rover was successfully
                            deployed on 22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to successfully deploy a
                            rover on Mars, after the United States.<br><br>

                            There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the
                            possibility of extant life. Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European
                            Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover.[39][40][41][42] Liquid water on the surface of
                            Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the
                            atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short
                            periods.[43][44][45] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.[46][47]
                            The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to
                            cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft).[48] In November 2016, NASA
                            reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The
                            volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in
                            Lake Superior.
                            Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its
                            apparent magnitude reaches −2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the
                            Sun.[13] Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features
                            about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's
                            atmosphere.

                            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of
                            the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares
                            (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the
                            third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
                            Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions
                            which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason,
                            scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from
                            the other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its
                            primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water,
                            ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest
                            planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C;
                            −371 °F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the
                            lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.[17] The interior of Uranus is
                            mainly composed of ices and rock.<br><br>

                            Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous
                            moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is
                            tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles,
                            therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.[22] In 1986, images from
                            Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
                            cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.[22] Voyager 2 remains the
                            only spacecraft to visit the planet.[23] Observations from Earth have shown seasonal
                            change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind
                            speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

                            Jupiter is most likely the oldest planet in the Solar System.[24] Current models of
                            Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line; a
                            distance from the early Sun where the temperature is sufficiently cold for volatiles
                            such as water to condense into solids.[25] It first assembled a large solid core before
                            accumulating its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the core must have formed before
                            the solar nebula began to dissipate after 10 million years. Formation models suggest
                            Jupiter grew to 20 times the mass of the Earth in under a million years. The orbiting
                            mass created a gap in the disk, thereafter slowly increasing to 50 Earth masses in 3–4
                            million years.[24]
                            According to the "grand tack hypothesis", Jupiter would have begun to form at a distance
                            of roughly 3.5 AU. As the young planet accreted mass, interaction with the gas disk
                            orbiting the Sun and orbital resonances with Saturn[25] caused it to migrate inward.[26]
                            This would have upset the orbits of what are believed to be super-Earths orbiting closer
                            to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively. Saturn would later have begun to
                            migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, leading to the two planets becoming
                            locked in a 3:2 mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU. This in turn would have
                            changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of
                            the inner system to their current locations.[27] These migrations would have occurred
                            over an 800,000 year time period,[26] with all of this happening over a time period of
                            up to 6 million years after Jupiter began to form (3 million being a more likely
                            figure).[28] This departure would have allowed the formation of the inner planets from
                            the rubble, including Earth.[29]<br><br>

                            However, the formation timescales of terrestrial planets resulting from the grand tack
                            hypothesis appear inconsistent with the measured terrestrial composition.[30] Moreover,
                            the likelihood that the outward migration actually occurred in the solar nebula is very
                            low.[31] In fact, some models predict the formation of Jupiter's analogues whose
                            properties are close to those of the planet at the current epoch.[32]
                            Other models have Jupiter forming at distances much further out, such as 18 AU.[33][34]
                            In fact, based on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial
                            formation outside the molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20-30
                            AU,[35][36] and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40 AU.
                            Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have migrated
                            inwards to its current location. This inward migration would have occurred over a
                            roughly 700,000 year time period,[33][34] during an epoch approximately 2–3 million
                            years after the planet began to form. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even
                            further out than Jupiter, and Saturn would also have migrated inwards.

                            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System,
                            after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times
                            that of Earth.[22][23] It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however,
                            with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[24][25][26] Saturn is
                            named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has
                            been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek
                            kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for
                            the planet.[27] It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added
                            at the top in the 16th century.
                            The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for
                            the planet Saturn.<br><br>

                            Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and
                            oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
                            intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer
                            layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An
                            electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to
                            Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has a
                            magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic
                            field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[29] The outer atmosphere is
                            generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind
                            speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but
                            not as high as on Neptune.
                            The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly
                            of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons[31]
                            are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the
                            hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest
                            in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is
                            the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.[32]

                            Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's
                            drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain plotted points that match up
                            with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems
                            to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to
                            Jupiter in the night sky.[27] Hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his
                            first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it
                            had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when
                            Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its
                            yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with
                            Galileo's small telescope.[28] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo was at least
                            aware that the "star" he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars.[29]
                            In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's
                            neighbour Uranus.[30] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the
                            tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit
                            through gravitational interaction.[31] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit
                            of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the
                            Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46
                            and produced several different estimates of a new planet<br><br>

                            n 1845–46, Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his own calculations but
                            aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first
                            published estimate of the planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate,
                            Airy persuaded James Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky
                            throughout August and September.[31][34]
                            Meanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann
                            Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, a student
                            at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of
                            the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek
                            the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening
                            of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune just
                            northeast of Iota Aquarii, 1° from the "five degrees east of Delta Capricorn" position
                            Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[35][36] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and on the
                            border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern IAU constellation boundaries.
                            Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but
                            did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was
                            distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[31][37]
                            In the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the
                            French and the British over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an
                            international consensus emerged that Le Verrier and Adams deserved joint credit. Since
                            1966, Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's claim to co-discovery,
                            and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the "Neptune
                            papers" (historical documents) to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
